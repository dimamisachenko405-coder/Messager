    /**
     * Core Philosophy: This ruleset implements a hybrid security model tailored for a real-time messaging application.
     * It combines a strict user-ownership model for personal data (like contacts) with a collaborative,
     * membership-based model for shared data (like chats and messages). The primary goal is to ensure
     * users can only access and modify data they explicitly own or are participants in.
     *
     * Data Structure:
     * - /userProfiles/{userId}: Publicly readable user data, writable only by the owner.
     * - /userProfiles/{userId}/contacts/{contactId}: A user's private contact list. Access is strictly confined to the list owner.
     * - /chats/{chatId}: Collaborative chat rooms. Access is governed by a `participantIds` array within each chat document.
     * - /chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}: Messages within a chat.
     * - /chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}/attachments/{attachmentId}: Attachments within a message.
     *
     * Key Security Decisions:
     * - User Profiles are discoverable (publicly readable) to allow users to find each other, but only the owner can modify their own profile.
     * - A user's contact list is strictly private, using a path-based security rule for simplicity and performance.
     * - Chat and message access is determined by checking for the user's UID in a `participantIds` list on the parent `Chat` document. This check is performed using a `get()` call, ensuring that the single source of truth for membership is always used for subcollection access.
     * - Message modification and deletion are restricted to the original sender to maintain conversation integrity.
     *
     * Denormalization for Authorization:
     * The `/chats/{chatId}` documents contain a `participantIds` array. This denormalization is critical, as it allows security rules
     * to authorize a user for an entire conversation tree (the chat, its messages, and attachments) with a single check, avoiding complex and impossible queries.
     *
     * Structural Segregation:
     * Public user information (`userProfiles`) is segregated into a top-level collection, while strictly private, user-owned data (`contacts`) is nested
     * in a subcollection under the user's path. This separation creates a clear security boundary and improves query performance.
